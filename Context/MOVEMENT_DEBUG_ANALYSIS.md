# Movement Debug Analysis

## Issue Summary
Input is being registered correctly (logs show MoveForward/MoveBackward being called with proper values and directions), but character is not moving in the game.

## What's Working
- Enhanced Input System is functioning
- Input actions are properly bound and triggering
- Direction calculations are correct (showing proper forward/right vectors)
- AddMovementInput is being called with correct parameters

## Potential Issues
1. Character Movement Component might be disabled or blocked
2. Character might be in an invalid state preventing movement
3. Gameplay Ability System effects might be blocking movement
4. Physics/collision issues
5. Character movement settings might be incorrect

## Debug Steps to Try
1. Check CharacterMovementComponent state
2. Verify character is not frozen/disabled
3. Check for blocking gameplay effects
4. Validate movement component settings
5. Test basic movement without GAS
